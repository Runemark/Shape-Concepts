    // A technique is a means of altering the drawing in some way
    // A technique can be composed of sub-techniques
    
    // Right now, in its simplest form, a technique is literally just placing a pixel
    // Not even a combination of pixels. Just A PIXEL.
    
    // MISSING FEATURES:
    // Reference Points/Guidelines
    // For example, in a CIRCLE, it is important to know where the center is.
    
    // DESIGN PROBLEM:
    // Different Techniques will require different (and often optional) paramters
    // 1 technique (point): Load them into the function parameters
    // 2 techniques (point, line): Load them generically into function parameters
    
    // Point requires only a coordinate
    
    // Point drawing technique
    
    // I need a TECHNIQUE to convert a concept abstract shape to a reality.
